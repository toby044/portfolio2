## Growing Up Digital

I didn’t grow up planning to be a developer—but I did grow up around technology. My childhood was full of computers, games, and the internet. My dad was the kind of person who always had some project running on an old machine or was tinkering with something obscure. I didn’t think much of it at the time—it was just normal.

We played games, built PCs, and occasionally broke things just to figure out how to fix them. I wasn’t consciously learning to code or build websites, but I was surrounded by digital stuff 24/7.

## The Moment It Made Sense

When it came time to pick a direction after school, I applied somewhat instinctively for a bachelor's degree in web development. I didn’t fully know what to expect—but once I started, everything clicked.

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, design systems, user experience—it all felt familiar, like I had been circling this world without realizing it. Suddenly, what I used to enjoy doing in my free time—tweaking websites, trying out new frameworks, customizing game UIs—was the same stuff I could do as a career.

## Finding My Path

That realization changed everything. Web development became more than just a degree or a job—it became the thing I genuinely enjoyed doing. I could build, solve problems, create interfaces, and see people actually use what I made.

And even though I didn’t grow up writing code, all those years around tech had quietly built the foundation.

## Why It Works for Me

Development in general is the perfect blend of logic, creativity, and impact. It rewards curiosity. It’s never static. There’s always something new to learn, improve, or reinvent.

For me, it wasn’t about being pushed toward tech—it was about recognizing the world I already felt comfortable in. Choosing development just made sense.
